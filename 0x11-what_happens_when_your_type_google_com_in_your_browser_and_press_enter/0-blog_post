1. DNS request: The browser first sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to resolve the domain name "google.com" to an IP address. DNS is a distributed database that maps human-readable domain names to numerical IP addresses that machines can understand.
2. TCP/IP: Once the IP address of the server is obtained, the browser establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server using the IP address. TCP is a communication protocol that ensures that data is delivered reliably and in the correct order over the internet.
3. Firewall: If the server has a firewall configured, the incoming connection request is checked against the firewall rules to determine whether it should be allowed or blocked. A firewall is a security system that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
4. HTTPS/SSL: Once the connection is established, the browser and the server exchange a series of messages to establish a secure, encrypted connection using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. SSL/TLS ensures that all data transmitted between the browser and the server is secure and confidential.
5. Load-balancer: If the server has a load balancer configured, the incoming request is directed to one of the servers in the server pool based on the load-balancing algorithm. A load balancer is a device that distributes incoming requests across a group of servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed and that the workload is distributed evenly.
6. Web server: The request is then passed on to the web server, which processes the request and generates a response. A web server is a software application that runs on a computer and listens for incoming HTTP requests from clients (browsers).
7. Application server: If the web server is serving a dynamic application, it may pass the request on to an application server, which executes the application code and generates a response. An application server is a software platform that provides an environment for running and managing applications.
8. Database: If the application requires data from a database, the application server may send a request to a database server to retrieve the data. A database is a structured collection of data stored in a computer system and accessed electronically.
9. Response: The response is then passed back through the web server and load balancer (if present), and is eventually returned to the browser, which renders the response for the user to see.
