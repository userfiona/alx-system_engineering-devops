Certainly, I can explain the specifics of the infrastructure components you mentioned:

Adding Additional Elements:

Reason: Additional elements are added to enhance reliability, performance, and scalability. Redundancy reduces the risk of downtime due to component failures. Load balancing distributes traffic to prevent overload on individual servers. Primary-Replica database clusters improve data availability and provide backup options.
Load Balancer Distribution Algorithm and Working:

Algorithm: Common distribution algorithms include Round Robin, Least Connections, and Weighted Round Robin/Least Connections.
Working: The load balancer distributes incoming requests among a group of servers based on the chosen algorithm. For example, with Round Robin, each request goes to the next server in line. This prevents any single server from being overwhelmed and optimizes resource utilization.
Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Load-Balancer Setup:

Active-Active: In an active-active setup, multiple load balancers work simultaneously, distributing traffic. It provides redundancy and increases capacity but requires more complex configuration and synchronization.
Active-Passive: In an active-passive setup, only one load balancer is active while the others remain on standby. If the active one fails, a passive one takes over. This setup is simpler but doesn't utilize resources as efficiently.
Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster:

Working: In a primary-replica cluster, the primary (master) node handles both read and write operations. Replicas (slaves) replicate data from the primary and handle read operations. As data is written to the primary, it's asynchronously propagated to the replicas. This enhances data availability, load distribution, and backup options.
Difference Between Primary Node and Replica Node for the Application:

Primary Node: The primary node handles write operations, ensuring data consistency and integrity. It's the authoritative source for data updates.
Replica Node: Replica nodes handle read operations, offloading the primary node and improving read scalability. They provide high availability and can be promoted to primary if needed.
These components and configurations work together to create a robust, high-performing, and reliable infrastructure. Load balancers distribute traffic efficiently, database clusters improve data availability, and redundant setups ensure that failures don't lead to service disruptions.
