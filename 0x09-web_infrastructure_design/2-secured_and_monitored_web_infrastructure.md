1.	Adding Additional Elements:
•	Reason: Additional elements are added to enhance various aspects of the infrastructure, such as performance, reliability, security, and scalability. For example, adding load balancers distributes traffic evenly, improving responsiveness and preventing overload on individual servers. Additional database replicas improve read scalability and data availability.
2.	Firewalls:
•	Purpose: Firewalls act as a security barrier between the internal network and external threats. They analyze and control incoming and outgoing network traffic, allowing authorized traffic while blocking unauthorized or potentially malicious traffic.
3.	Traffic Served over HTTPS:
•	Purpose: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) encrypts the data transmitted between a user's browser and the web server. This encryption ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials, payment details, and personal data, remains confidential and protected from interception or tampering by attackers.
4.	Monitoring:
•	Purpose: Monitoring involves tracking the performance, health, and security of the infrastructure and applications. It helps identify issues, anomalies, and potential threats in real-time, allowing administrators to take proactive measures to ensure optimal system operation, minimize downtime, and address security breaches.
5.	Collecting Data in Monitoring:
•	Method: Monitoring tools collect data through various methods, including agent-based or agentless monitoring. Agents may be installed on servers to collect and transmit data to a centralized monitoring system. Agentless monitoring relies on protocols and interfaces provided by the monitored components to gather data without installing agents.
6.	Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second):
•	Steps:
1.	Select a Monitoring Tool: Choose a monitoring tool that supports web server monitoring and provides QPS metrics.
2.	Configure Monitoring: Set up the monitoring tool to target the specific web server you want to monitor.
3.	Select Metrics: Configure the tool to track metrics related to QPS, such as incoming request counts over time.
4.	Visualization: Use the monitoring tool's dashboard or interface to visualize QPS trends and patterns.
5.	Alerting: Set up alerts to be notified if QPS exceeds certain thresholds or if anomalies are detected.
6.	Analysis and Optimization: Analyze the QPS data to understand usage patterns, peak traffic times, and potential bottlenecks. This information can guide optimization efforts and capacity planning.
Monitoring QPS helps ensure that your web server can handle the expected traffic load, allowing you to make informed decisions about scaling resources, optimizing performance, and improving user experience.
By addressing these specifics, you can create a well-rounded and optimized infrastructure that is secure, performant, and reliable.
